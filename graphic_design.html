    <h1>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h1>

    <p>I have always had a passion for art and beginning my senior year of high school I have dabbled in the graphic design medium. Since then, I’ve done small freelance projects for friends’ sports teams and student organizations, as well as work through the UMSI graphic design courses SI 320 and SI 616. Check out some of my work below!</p>

    <h2>PERSONAL BRANDING PROJECT</h2>
    <h3>SI 320 - GRAPHIC DESIGN</h3>
    <p>For my graphic design final project, we had to create a personal branding set, including logo, business cards, websites and more. I wanted this design to be very simple and clean. To achieve this I used the thin lines of the Helvetica  Neue Thin typeface and the circle motif throughout the design elements. The images used for my portfolio section of my webpage are actual images of my work in data analytics, graphic design, and web development. They also follow the color scheme of the rest of the piece.</p>

    <h3>PERSONAL PROJECT</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite podcasts is <a href="http://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</a>. Using the colors from their original podcast cover art, these are some different redesigns I made to experiment with different design elements.</p>

    <h2>GALAXY SUSTAINABILITY CONFERENCE LOGO</h2>
    <h3>SI 320 - GRAPHIC DESIGN</h3>
    <p>In SI 320, we created a sample logo for the Galaxy Sustainability Conference hosted in Ann Arbor. The logo seeks to represent the five different branches of the conference (the Policy in  Practice Charrettes, the Case Creation Studios, the Inclusive Design Sprint, the Case  Premiere, and the Award Ceremony & Gala). The main shape of the logo also represents a galaxy with incorporating the arrows from the universal recycling symbol.</p>

    <h3>PERSONAL PROJECT FOR TAKE BACK THE NIGHT ANN ARBOR</h3>
    <p>A large part of my undergraduate experience has been being a part of the Ann Arbor chapter of Take Back the Night. Our main event each year is a march and rally that takes place in the University of Michigan’s Union that advocates for survivors of sexual assault. This poster is a redesign of our current poster to make the poster more eye-catching for advertising around campus.</p>

    <h2>MAC ASB LEAD TEAM APPAREL DESIGN</h2>
    <h3>PERSONAL PROJECT FOR MAC ASB LEAD TEAM</h3>
    <p>The Michigan Active Citizens Alternative Spring Break Lead Team was looking for a logo for this year’s apparel. The general logo for MAC ASB includes a leaf, which inspired this redesign to include a text and leaf version of the logo.</p>
