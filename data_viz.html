    <h1>DATA VISUALIZATIONS</h1>


    <p>I am a firm believer in making data accessible and the understanding of this information available to a wide audience. One type of data analysis deliverables that are easy to consume and digest are data visualizations. Check out some of my work below from my previous internships and UMSI classes.</p>

    <h2>PHYSICIAN NETWORK DIAGRAM</h2>
    <h3>TRINITY HEALTH - POPULATION HEALTH ANALYTICS</h3>
    <p>At my internship at Trinity Health, one of my main projects was to investigate the networks created through relationships between primary care providers and specialist physicians. This data visualizations maps these relationships at the healthcare practice level and could be used by physicians to consider their referral patterns within a network of physicians.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>ATTRIBUTED POPULATIONS DEMOGRAPHICS</h2>
    <h3>TRINITY HEALTH - POPULATION HEALTH ANALYTICS</h3>
    <p>The Population Health Analytics team at Trinity Health creates many different reports regarding the population that utilizes Trinity Health facilities for use by physicians, hospital administration and Trinity executives. One common concern among these stakeholders is the breakdown of the population in each of these reports. I collaborated with other interns to create this Tableau report that shows the demographics of the populations attributed to Trinity Health facilities. </p>

    <h2>ISOMETRIC COMMUNITY HEALTH MODEL</h2>
    <h3>TRINITY HEALTH - POPULATION HEALTH ANALYTICS</h3>
    <p>Navigating the health care system can be very confusing and difficult for many. This project looks to visualize the many physical locations available in the health care system, specific to Trinity Health, to help those trying to maneuver in this complex system. </p>

    <h2>HEALTH-RELATED GOOGLE SEARCH ANALYSIS</h2>
    <h3>SI 370 - DATA MANIPULATION</h3>
    <p>For this project, I investigated datasets that relate data and healthcare and found the <a href="http://www.searching-for-health.com/">Searching for Health </a> interactive data visualization tool. This tool looks at different Google search trends by U.S. county across the last 13 years. I found the way people are using the internet to investigate and become more attuned with their health very interesting and wanted to explore this data further. I focused primarily on differences across geographic locations and over time to see if there were any interesting patterns in the way people are using Google to search for health-related information.
